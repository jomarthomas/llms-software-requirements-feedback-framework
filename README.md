# Integrating LLMs in Software Requirements Engineering: A Feedback-Driven Framework for Quality, Consistency, and Adaptability

## Overview
This repository supports the research project: *Integrating LLMs in Software Requirements Engineering: A Feedback-Driven Framework for Quality, Consistency, and Adaptability*. The project explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to iteratively refine software requirements, leveraging MATLAB's Requirements Toolbox and empirical evaluation methodologies.

## Features
- Iterative feedback loops for refining requirements.
- Empirical evaluation of quality metrics (e.g., correctness, completeness).
- Comprehensive datasets for benchmarking (NASA, JWST, ReqView).

## Repository Structure
- `datasets/`: NASA, JWST, and ReqView datasets for empirical testing.
- `scripts/`: MATLAB tools for importing, refining, and evaluating requirements.
- `results/`: Logs, metrics, and findings from iterative feedback loops.
- `docs/`: Methodology, literature reviews, and tools documentation.
- `latex-docs/`: IEEE-formatted LaTeX paper files for RE 2025.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/llms-software-requirements-feedback-framework.git

2. Install MATLAB and Requirements Toolbox.
3. Follow instructions in docs/methodology.md to replicate experiments.
